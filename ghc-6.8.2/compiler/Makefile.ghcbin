# This Makefile builds the GHC binary for stage2.  In stage2, the GHC binary
# is built as a single Main module that links to the GHC package.  It
# is easier to do this with a separate Makefile, because we don't want most
# of the options normally dumped into SRC_HC_OPTS by the main GHC Makefile.
# In particular, we don't want the .hi files picked up along the home package
# search path when compiling Main, we need the compiler to find them in
# the GHC package.
