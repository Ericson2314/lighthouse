FunDeps - functional dependencies

\subsection{Close type variables}
%*									*
%************************************************************************

  oclose(vs,C)	The result of extending the set of tyvars vs
		using the functional dependencies from C

  grow(vs,C)	The result of extend the set of tyvars vs
		using all conceivable links from C.

		E.g. vs = {a}, C = {H [a] b, K (b,Int) c, Eq e}
		Then grow(vs,C) = {a,b,c}

		Note that grow(vs,C) `superset` grow(vs,simplify(C))
		That is, simplfication can only shrink the result of grow.

Notice that
   oclose is conservative 	v `elem` oclose(vs,C)
          one way:     		 => v is definitely fixed by vs

   grow is conservative		if v might be fixed by vs 
          the other way:	=> v `elem` grow(vs,C)

----------------------------------------------------------
(oclose preds tvs) closes the set of type variables tvs, 
wrt functional dependencies in preds.  The result is a superset
of the argument set.  For example, if we have
	class C a b | a->b where ...
then
	oclose [C (x,y) z, C (x,p) q] {x,y} = {x,y,z}
because if we know x and y then that fixes z.

oclose is used (only) when generalising a type T; see extensive
notes in TcSimplify.

Note [Important subtlety in oclose]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider (oclose (C Int t) {}), where class C a b | a->b
Then, since a->b, 't' is fully determined by Int, and the
uniform thing is to return {t}.

However, consider
	class D a b c | b->c
	f x = e	  -- 'e' generates constraint (D s Int t)
		  -- \x.e has type s->s
Then, if (oclose (D s Int t) {}) = {t}, we'll make the function
monomorphic in 't', thus
	f :: forall s. D s Int t => s -> s

But if this function is never called, 't' will never be instantiated;
the functional dependencies that fix 't' may well be instance decls in
some importing module.  But the top-level defaulting of unconstrained
type variables will fix t=GHC.Prim.Any, and that's simply a bug.

Conclusion: oclose only returns a type variable as "fixed" if it 
depends on at least one type variable in the input fixed_tvs.

Remember, it's always sound for oclose to return a smaller set.
An interesting example is tcfail093, where we get this inferred type:
    class C a b | a->b
    dup :: forall h. (Call (IO Int) h) => () -> Int -> h
This is perhaps a bit silly, because 'h' is fixed by the (IO Int);
previously GHC rejected this saying 'no instance for Call (IO Int) h'.
But it's right on the borderline. If there was an extra, otherwise
uninvolved type variable, like 's' in the type of 'f' above, then
we must accept the function.  So, for now anyway, we accept 'dup' too.

\begin{code}
oclose :: [PredType] -> TyVarSet -> TyVarSet
oclose preds fixed_tvs
  | null tv_fds 	    = fixed_tvs	   -- Fast escape hatch for common case
  | isEmptyVarSet fixed_tvs = emptyVarSet  -- Note [Important subtlety in oclose]
  | otherwise 		    = loop fixed_tvs
  where
    loop fixed_tvs
	| new_fixed_tvs `subVarSet` fixed_tvs = fixed_tvs
	| otherwise		  	      = loop new_fixed_tvs
	where
	  new_fixed_tvs = foldl extend fixed_tvs tv_fds

    extend fixed_tvs (ls,rs) 
	| not (isEmptyVarSet ls)	-- Note [Important subtlety in oclose]
	, ls `subVarSet` fixed_tvs = fixed_tvs `unionVarSet` rs
	| otherwise		   = fixed_tvs

    tv_fds  :: [(TyVarSet,TyVarSet)]
	-- In our example, tv_fds will be [ ({x,y}, {z}), ({x,p},{q}) ]
	-- Meaning "knowing x,y fixes z, knowing x,p fixes q"
    tv_fds  = [ (tyVarsOfTypes xs, tyVarsOfTypes ys)
	      | ClassP cls tys <- preds,		-- Ignore implicit params
		let (cls_tvs, cls_fds) = classTvsFds cls,
		fd <- cls_fds,
		let (xs,ys) = instFD fd cls_tvs tys
	      ]
\end{code}

Note [Growing the tau-tvs using constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(grow preds tvs) is the result of extend the set of tyvars tvs
		 using all conceivable links from pred

E.g. tvs = {a}, preds = {H [a] b, K (b,Int) c, Eq e}
Then grow precs tvs = {a,b,c}

All the type variables from an implicit parameter are added, whether or
not they are mentioned in tvs; see Note [Implicit parameters and ambiguity] 
in TcSimplify.

See also Note [Ambiguity] in TcSimplify

\begin{code}
grow :: [PredType] -> TyVarSet -> TyVarSet
grow preds fixed_tvs 
  | null preds = fixed_tvs
  | otherwise  = loop real_fixed_tvs
  where
	-- Add the implicit parameters; 
	-- see Note [Implicit parameters and ambiguity] in TcSimplify
    real_fixed_tvs = foldr unionVarSet fixed_tvs ip_tvs
 
    loop fixed_tvs
	| new_fixed_tvs `subVarSet` fixed_tvs = fixed_tvs
	| otherwise		  	      = loop new_fixed_tvs
	where
	  new_fixed_tvs = foldl extend fixed_tvs non_ip_tvs

    extend fixed_tvs pred_tvs 
	| fixed_tvs `intersectsVarSet` pred_tvs = fixed_tvs `unionVarSet` pred_tvs
	| otherwise			        = fixed_tvs

    (ip_tvs, non_ip_tvs) = partitionWith get_ip preds
    get_ip (IParam _ ty) = Left (tyVarsOfType ty)
    get_ip other         = Right (tyVarsOfPred other)

\subsection{Generate equations from functional dependencies}
%*									*
%************************************************************************


\begin{code}
type Equation = (TyVarSet, [(Type, Type)])
-- These pairs of types should be equal, for some
-- substitution of the tyvars in the tyvar set
-- INVARIANT: corresponding types aren't already equal

-- It's important that we have a *list* of pairs of types.  Consider
-- 	class C a b c | a -> b c where ...
--	instance C Int x x where ...
-- Then, given the constraint (C Int Bool v) we should improve v to Bool,
-- via the equation ({x}, [(Bool,x), (v,x)])
-- This would not happen if the class had looked like
--	class C a b c | a -> b, a -> c

-- To "execute" the equation, make fresh type variable for each tyvar in the set,
-- instantiate the two types with these fresh variables, and then unify.
--
-- For example, ({a,b}, (a,Int,b), (Int,z,Bool))
-- We unify z with Int, but since a and b are quantified we do nothing to them
-- We usually act on an equation by instantiating the quantified type varaibles
-- to fresh type variables, and then calling the standard unifier.

pprEquation (qtvs, pairs) 
  = vcat [ptext SLIT("forall") <+> braces (pprWithCommas ppr (varSetElems qtvs)),
	  nest 2 (vcat [ ppr t1 <+> ptext SLIT(":=:") <+> ppr t2 | (t1,t2) <- pairs])]
\end{code}

Given a bunch of predicates that must hold, such as

	C Int t1, C Int t2, C Bool t3, ?x::t4, ?x::t5

improve figures out what extra equations must hold.
For example, if we have

	class C a b | a->b where ...

then improve will return

	[(t1,t2), (t4,t5)]

NOTA BENE:

  * improve does not iterate.  It's possible that when we make
    t1=t2, for example, that will in turn trigger a new equation.
    This would happen if we also had
	C t1 t7, C t2 t8
    If t1=t2, we also get t7=t8.

    improve does *not* do this extra step.  It relies on the caller
    doing so.

  * The equations unify types that are not already equal.  So there
    is no effect iff the result of improve is empty

\end{code}

Note [Coverage condition]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For the coverage condition, we used to require only that 
	fv(t2) `subset` oclose(fv(t1), theta)

Example:
	class Mul a b c | a b -> c where
		(.*.) :: a -> b -> c

	instance Mul Int Int Int where (.*.) = (*)
	instance Mul Int Float Float where x .*. y = fromIntegral x * y
	instance Mul a b c => Mul a [b] [c] where x .*. v = map (x.*.) v

In the third instance, it's not the case that fv([c]) `subset` fv(a,[b]).
But it is the case that fv([c]) `subset` oclose( theta, fv(a,[b]) )

But it is a mistake to accept the instance because then this defn:
	f = \ b x y -> if b then x .*. [y] else y
makes instance inference go into a loop, because it requires the constraint
	Mul a [b] b


%************************************************************************
%*									*
	Check that a new instance decl is OK wrt fundeps
%*									*
%************************************************************************

Here is the bad case:
	class C a b | a->b where ...
	instance C Int Bool where ...
	instance C Int Char where ...

The point is that a->b, so Int in the first parameter must uniquely
determine the second.  In general, given the same class decl, and given

	instance C s1 s2 where ...
	instance C t1 t2 where ...

Then the criterion is: if U=unify(s1,t1) then U(s2) = U(t2).

Matters are a little more complicated if there are free variables in
the s2/t2.  

	class D a b c | a -> b
	instance D a b => D [(a,a)] [b] Int
	instance D a b => D [a]     [b] Bool

The instance decls don't overlap, because the third parameter keeps
them separate.  But we want to make sure that given any constraint
	D s1 s2 s3
if s1 matches
