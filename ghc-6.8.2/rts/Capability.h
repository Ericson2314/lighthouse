 *
 * Capabilities
 *
 * The notion of a capability is used when operating in multi-threaded
 * environments (which the THREADED_RTS build of the RTS does), to
 * hold all the state an OS thread/task needs to run Haskell code:
 * its STG registers, a pointer to its  TSO, a nursery etc. During
 * STG execution, a pointer to the capabilitity is kept in a 
 * register (BaseReg).
 *
 * Only in an THREADED_RTS build will there be multiple capabilities,
 * in the non-threaded builds there is one global capability, namely
 * MainCapability.
 *
 * This header file contains the functions for working with capabilities.
 * (the main, and only, consumer of this interface is the scheduler).
