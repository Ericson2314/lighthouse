/*
 The IOManager subsystem provides a non-blocking view
 of I/O operations. It lets one (or more) OS thread(s)
 issue multiple I/O requests, which the IOManager then 
 handles independently of/concurrent to the thread(s)
 that issued the request. Upon completion, the issuing
 thread can inspect the result of the I/O operation &
 take appropriate action.

 The IOManager is intended used with the GHC RTS to
 implement non-blocking I/O in Concurrent Haskell.
