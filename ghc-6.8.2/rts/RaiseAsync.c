   throwTo

   This function may be used to throw an exception from one thread to
   another, during the course of normal execution.  This is a tricky
   task: the target thread might be running on another CPU, or it
   may be blocked and could be woken up at any point by another CPU.
   We have some delicate synchronisation to do.

   There is a completely safe fallback scheme: it is always possible
   to just block the source TSO on the target TSO's blocked_exceptions
   queue.  This queue is locked using lockTSO()/unlockTSO().  It is
   checked at regular intervals: before and after running a thread
   (schedule() and threadPaused() respectively), and just before GC
   (scheduleDoGC()).  Activating a thread on this queue should be done
   using maybePerformBlockedException(): this is done in the context
   of the target thread, so the exception can be raised eagerly.

   This fallback scheme works even if the target thread is complete or
   killed: scheduleDoGC() will discover the blocked thread before the
   target is GC'd.

   Blocking the source thread on the target thread's blocked_exception
   queue is also employed when the target thread is currently blocking
   exceptions (ie. inside Control.Exception.block).

   We could use the safe fallback scheme exclusively, but that
   wouldn't be ideal: most calls to throwTo would block immediately,
   possibly until the next GC, which might require the deadlock
   detection mechanism to kick in.  So we try to provide promptness
   wherever possible.

   We can promptly deliver the exception if the target thread is:

     - runnable, on the same Capability as the source thread (because
       we own the run queue and therefore the target thread).
   
     - blocked, and we can obtain exclusive access to it.  Obtaining
       exclusive access to the thread depends on how it is blocked.

   We must also be careful to not trip over threadStackOverflow(),
   which might be moving the TSO to enlarge its stack.
   lockTSO()/unlockTSO() are used here too.

   Returns: 

   THROWTO_SUCCESS    exception was raised, ok to continue

   THROWTO_BLOCKED    exception was not raised; block the source
                      thread then call throwToReleaseTarget() when
		      the source thread is properly tidied away.

	   How do we establish this condition?  Very carefully.

	   Let 
	       P = (status == NotBlocked)
	       Q = (tso->cap == cap)
	       
	   Now, if P & Q are true, then the TSO is locked and owned by
	   this capability.  No other OS thread can steal it.

	   If P==0 and Q==1: the TSO is blocked, but attached to this
	   capabilty, and it can be stolen by another capability.
	   
	   If P==1 and Q==0: the TSO is runnable on another
	   capability.  At any time, the TSO may change from runnable
	   to blocked and vice versa, while it remains owned by
	   another capability.

	   Suppose we test like this:

	      p = P
	      q = Q
	      if (p && q) ...

	    this is defeated by another capability stealing a blocked
	    TSO from us to wake it up (Schedule.c:unblockOne()).  The
	    other thread is doing

	      Q = 0
	      P = 1

	    assuming arbitrary reordering, we could see this
	    interleaving:

	      start: P==0 && Q==1 
	      P = 1
	      p = P
	      q = Q
	      Q = 0
	      if (p && q) ...
	       
	    so we need a memory barrier:

	      p = P
	      mb()
	      q = Q
	      if (p && q) ...

	    this avoids the problematic case.  There are other cases
	    to consider, but this is the tricky one.

	    Note that we must be sure that unblockOne() does the
	    writes in the correct order: Q before P.  The memory
	    barrier ensures that if we have seen the write to P, we
	    have also seen the write to Q.

/* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * raiseAsync()
 *
 * The following function implements the magic for raising an
 * asynchronous exception in an existing thread.
 *
 * We first remove the thread from any queue on which it might be
 * blocked.  The possible blockages are BLACKHOLE_BQs.
 *
 * We strip the stack down to the innermost CATCH_FRAME, building
 * thunks in the heap for all the active computations, so they can 
 * be restarted if necessary.  When we reach a CATCH_FRAME, we build
 * an application of the handler to the exception, and push it on
 * the top of the stack.
 * 
 * How exactly do we save all the active computations?  We create an
 * AP_STACK for every UpdateFrame on the stack.  Entering one of these
 * AP_STACKs pushes everything from the corresponding update frame
 * upwards onto the stack.  (Actually, it pushes everything up to the
 * next update frame plus a pointer to the next AP_STACK object.
 * Entering the next AP_STACK object pushes more onto the stack until we
 * reach the last AP_STACK object - at which point the stack should look
 * exactly as it did when we killed the TSO and we can continue
 * execution by entering the closure on top of the stack.
 *
 * We can also kill a thread entirely - this happens if either (a) the 
 * exception passed to raiseAsync is NULL, or (b) there's no
 * CATCH_FRAME on the stack.  In either case, we strip the entire
 * stack and replace the thread with a zombie.
 *
 * ToDo: in THREADED_RTS mode, this function is only safe if either
 * (a) we hold all the Capabilities (eg. in GC, or if there is only
 * one Capability), or (b) we own the Capability that the TSO is
 * currently blocked on or on the run queue of.
