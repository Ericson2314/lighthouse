-- search for definitions of things 
-- we do this by looking for the following patterns:
-- data XXX = ...      giving a datatype location
-- newtype XXX = ...   giving a newtype location
-- bla :: ...          giving a function location
--
-- by doing it this way, we avoid picking up local definitions
-- 		(whether this is good or not is a matter for debate)
--

-- We generate both CTAGS and ETAGS format tags files
-- The former is for use in most sensible editors, while EMACS uses ETAGS
