    <h1>On why we have <tt>ForeignPtr</tt></h1>

    <p>Unfortunately it isn't possible to add a finalizer to a normal
    <tt>Ptr a</tt>.  We already have a generic finalization mechanism:
    see the Weak module in package lang.  But the only reliable way to
    use finalizers is to attach one to an atomic heap object - that
    way the compiler's optimiser can't interfere with the lifetime of
    the object.

    <p>The <tt>Ptr</tt> type is really just a boxed address - it's
    defined like

    <pre>
data Ptr a = Ptr Addr#
</pre>

    <p>where <tt>Addr#</tt> is an unboxed native address (just a 32-
    or 64- bit word).  Putting a finalizer on a <tt>Ptr</tt> is
    dangerous, because the compiler's optimiser might remove the box
    altogether.

    <p><tt>ForeignPtr</tt> is defined like this

    <pre>
data ForeignPtr a = ForeignPtr ForeignObj#
</pre>

    <p>where <tt>ForeignObj#</tt> is a *boxed* address, it corresponds
    to a real heap object.  The heap object is primitive from the
    point of view of the compiler - it can't be optimised away.  So it
    works to attach a finalizer to the <tt>ForeignObj#</tt> (but not
    to the <tt>ForeignPtr</tt>!).

    <p>There are several primitive objects to which we can attach
    finalizers: <tt>MVar#</tt>, <tt>MutVar#</tt>, <tt>ByteArray#</tt>,
    etc.  We have special functions for some of these: eg.
    <tt>MVar.addMVarFinalizer</tt>.

    <p>So a nicer interface might be something like

<pre>
class Finalizable a where
   addFinalizer :: a -> IO () -> IO ()

instance Finalizable (ForeignPtr a) where ...
instance Finalizable (MVar a) where ...
</pre>

    <p>So you might ask why we don't just get rid of <tt>Ptr</tt> and
    rename <tt>ForeignPtr</tt> to <tt>Ptr</tt>.  The reason for that
    is just efficiency, I think.
