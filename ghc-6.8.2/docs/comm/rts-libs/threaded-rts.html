    <h1>The GHC Commentary - The Multi-threaded runtime, and multiprocessor execution</h1>
    
    <p>This section of the commentary explains the structure of the runtime system
      when used in threaded or SMP mode.</p>

    <p>The <em>threaded</em> version of the runtime supports
      bound threads and non-blocking foreign calls, and an overview of its
      design can be found in the paper <a
	href="http://www.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/conc-ffi.pdf">Extending
	the Haskell Foreign Function Interface with Concurrency</a>.  To
      compile the runtime with threaded support, add the line

<pre>GhcRTSWays += thr</pre>

    to <tt>mk/build.mk</tt>.  When building C code in the runtime for the threaded way,
      the symbol <tt>THREADED_RTS</tt> is defined (this is arranged by the
      build system when building for way <tt>thr</tt>, see
      <tt>mk/config.mk</tt>).  To build a Haskell program
      with the threaded runtime, pass the flag <tt>-threaded</tt> to GHC (this
      can be used in conjunction with <tt>-prof</tt>, and possibly
      <tt>-debug</tt> and others depending on which versions of the RTS have
      been built.</p>

    <p>The <em>SMP</em> version runtime supports the same facilities as the
      threaded version, and in addition supports execution of Haskell code by
      multiple simultaneous OS threads.  For SMP support, both the runtime and
      the libraries must be built a special way: add the lines

   <pre>
GhcRTSWays += thr
GhcLibWays += s</pre>

    to <tt>mk/build.mk</tt>.  To build Haskell code for
      SMP execution, use the flag <tt>-smp</tt> to GHC (this can be used in
      conjunction with <tt>-debug</tt>, but no other way-flags at this time).
      When building C code in the runtime for SMP
      support, the symbol <tt>SMP</tt> is defined (this is arranged by the
      compiler when the <tt>-smp</tt> flag is given, see
      <tt>ghc/compiler/main/StaticFlags.hs</tt>).</p>

    <p>When building the runtime in either the threaded or SMP ways, the symbol
      <tt>RTS_SUPPORTS_THREADS</tt> will be defined (see <tt>Rts.h</tt>).</p>

    <h2>Overall design</h2>

    <p>The system is based around the notion of a <tt>Capability</tt>.  A
      <tt>Capability</tt> is an object that represents both the permission to
      execute some Haskell code, and the state required to do so.  In order
      to execute some Haskell code, a thread must therefore hold a
      <tt>Capability</tt>.  The available pool of capabilities is managed by
      the <tt>Capability</tt> API, described below.</p>

    <p>In the threaded runtime, there is only a single <tt>Capabililty</tt> in the
      system, indicating that only a single thread can be executing Haskell
      code at any one time.  In the SMP runtime, there can be an arbitrary
      number of capabilities selectable at runtime with the <tt>+RTS -N<em>n</em></tt>
      flag; in practice the number is best chosen to be the same as the number of
      processors on the host machine.</p>

    <p>There are a number of OS threads running code in the runtime.  We call
      these <em>tasks</em> to avoid confusion with Haskell <em>threads</em>.
      Tasks are managed by the <tt>Task</tt> subsystem, which is mainly
      concerned with keeping track of statistics such as how much time each
      task spends executing Haskell code, and also keeping track of how many
      tasks are around when we want to shut down the runtime.</p>

    <p>Some tasks are created by the runtime itself, and some may be here
      as a result of a call to Haskell from foreign code (we
      call this an in-call).  The
      runtime can support any number of concurrent foreign in-calls, but the
      number of these calls that will actually run Haskell code in parallel is
      determined by the number of available capabilities.  Each in-call creates
      a <em>bound thread</em>, as described in the FFI/Concurrency paper (cited
      above).</p>

    <p>In the future we may want to bind a <tt>Capability</tt> to a particular
      processor, so that we can support a notion of affinity - avoiding
      accidental migration of work from one CPU to another, so that we can make
      best use of a CPU's local cache.  For now, the design ignores this
      issue.</p>

    <h2>The <tt>OSThreads</tt> interface</h2>

    <p>This interface is merely an abstraction layer over the OS-specific APIs
      for managing threads.  It has two main implementations: Win32 and
      POSIX.</p>

    <p>This is the entirety of the interface:</p>

<pre>
/* Various abstract types */
typedef Mutex;
typedef Condition;
typedef OSThreadId;

extern OSThreadId osThreadId      ( void );
extern void shutdownThread        ( void );
extern void yieldThread           ( void );
extern int  createOSThread        ( OSThreadId* tid,
				    void (*startProc)(void) );

extern void initCondition         ( Condition* pCond );
extern void closeCondition        ( Condition* pCond );
extern rtsBool broadcastCondition ( Condition* pCond );
extern rtsBool signalCondition    ( Condition* pCond );
extern rtsBool waitCondition      ( Condition* pCond, 
				    Mutex* pMut );

extern void initMutex             ( Mutex* pMut );
    </pre>
