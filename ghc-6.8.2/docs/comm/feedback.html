    <h1>Feedback</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="mailto:chak@cse.unsw.edu.au">I</a> welcome any feedback on the
      material and in particular would appreciated comments on which parts of
      the document are incomprehensible or miss explanation -- e.g., due to
      the use of GHC speak that is explained nowhere (words like infotable or
      so).  Moreover, I would be interested to know which areas of GHC you
      would like to see covered here.
    <p>
      For the moment is probably best if feedback is directed to 
    <p>
    <blockquote>
      <a
	 href="mailto:chak@cse.unsw.edu.au"><code>chak@cse.unsw.edu.au</code></a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      However, if there is sufficient interest, we might consider setting up a
      mailing list.
