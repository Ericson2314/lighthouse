    <h1>The GHC Commentary - The Mighty Simplifier</h1>
    <p>
      Most of the optimising program transformations applied by GHC are
      performed on an intermediate language called <em>Core,</em> which
      essentially is a compiler-friendly formulation of rank-2 polymorphic
      lambda terms defined in the module <a
	href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/coreSyn/CoreSyn.lhs/"><code>CoreSyn.lhs</code>.</a>
      The transformation engine optimising Core programs is called the
      <em>Simplifier</em> and composed from a couple of modules located in the
      directory <a
	href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/simplCore/"><code>fptools/ghc/compiler/simplCore/</code>.</a>
      The main engine of the simplifier is contained in <a
	href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/simplCore/Simplify.lhs"><code>Simplify.lhs</code>.</a>
      and its driver is the routine <code>core2core</code> in <a
	href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/simplCore/SimplCore.lhs"><code>SimplCore.lhs</code>.</a>
    <p>
      The program that the simplifier has produced after applying its various
      optimisations can be obtained by passing the option
      <code>-ddump-simpl</code> to GHC.  Moreover, the various intermediate
      stages of the optimisation process is printed when passing
      <code>-dverbose-core2core</code>.

    <h4><a name="loopBreaker">Recursive Definitions</a></h4>
    <p>
      The simplification process has to take special care when handling
      recursive binding groups; otherwise, the compiler might loop.
      Therefore, the routine <code>reOrderRec</code> in <a
	href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/simplCore/OccurAnal.lhs"><code>OccurAnal.lhs</code></a>
      computes a set of <em>loop breakers</em> - a set of definitions that
      together cut any possible loop in the binding group.  It marks the
      identifiers bound by these definitions as loop breakers by enriching
      their <a href="basicTypes.html#occInfo">occurence information.</a>  Loop
      breakers will <em>never</em> be inlined by the simplifier; thus,
      guaranteeing termination of the simplification procedure.  (This is not
      entirely accurate -- see <a href="#rules">rewrite rules</a> below.)

      The processes finding loop breakers works as follows: First, the
      strongly connected components (SCC) of the graph representing all
      function dependencies is computed.  Then, each SCC is inspected in turn.
      If it contains only a single binding (self-recursive function), this is
      the loop breaker.  In case of multiple recursive bindings, the function
      attempts to select bindings where the decision not to inline them does
      cause the least harm - in the sense of inhibiting optimisations in the
      code.  This is achieved by considering each binding in turn and awarding
      a <em>score</em> between 0 and 4, where a lower score means that the
      function is less useful for inlining - and thus, a better loop breaker.
      The evaluation of bingings is performed by the function
      <code>score</code> locally defined in <code>OccurAnal</code>.
      
      Note that, because core programs represent function definitions as
      <em>one</em> binding choosing between the possibly many equations in the
      source program with a <code>case</code> construct, a loop breaker cannot
      inline any of its possibly many alternatives (not even the non-recursive
      alternatives).

    <h4><a name="rules">Rewrite Rules</a></h4>
    <p>
      The application of rewrite rules is controlled in the module <a
	href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/simplCore/Simplify.lhs"><code>Simplify.lhs</code></a>
      by the function <code>completeCall</code>.  This function first checks
      whether it should inline the function applied at the currently inspected
      call site, then simplifies the arguments, and finally, checks whether
      any rewrite rule can be applied (and also whether there is a matching
      specialised version of the applied function).  The actual check for rule
      application is performed by the function <code><a
	href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/specialise/Rules.lhs">Rules</a>.lookupRule</code>.
    <p>
      It should be note that the application of rewrite rules is not subject
      to the loop breaker check - i.e., rules of loop breakers will be applied
      regardless of whether this may cause the simplifier to diverge.
