    <h1>The GHC Commentary - The Glorious Renamer</h1>
    <p>
      The <em>renamer</em> sits between the parser and the typechecker.
      However, its operation is quite tightly interwoven with the
      typechecker.  This is partially due to support for Template Haskell,
      where spliced code has to be renamed and type checked.  In particular,
      top-level splices lead to multiple rounds of renaming and type
      checking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main externally used functions of the renamer are provided by the
      module <code>rename/RnSource.lhs</code>.  In particular, we have
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
rnSrcDecls  :: HsGroup RdrName -> RnM (TcGblEnv, HsGroup Name)
rnTyClDecls :: [LTyClDecl RdrName] -> RnM [LTyClDecl Name]
rnSplice    :: HsSplice RdrName -> RnM (HsSplice Name, FreeVars)</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      All of which execute in the renamer monad <code>RnM</code>.  The first
      function, <code>rnSrcDecls</code> renames a binding group; the second,
      <code>rnTyClDecls</code> renames a list of (toplevel) type and class
      declarations; and the third, <code>rnSplice</code> renames a Template
      Haskell splice.  As the types indicate, the main task of the renamer is
      to convert converts all the <tt>RdrNames</tt> to <a
      href="names.html"><tt>Names</tt></a>, which includes a number of
      well-formedness checks (no duplicate declarations, all names are in
      scope, and so on).  In addition, the renamer performs other, not
      strictly name-related, well-formedness checks, which includes checking
      that the appropriate flags have been supplied whenever language
      extensions are used in the source.
    </p>

    <h2>RdrNames</h2>
    <p>
      A <tt>RdrName.RdrName</tt> is pretty much just a string (for an
      unqualified name like "<tt>f</tt>") or a pair of strings (for a
      qualified name like "<tt>M.f</tt>"):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
data RdrName 
  = Unqual OccName
	-- Used for ordinary, unqualified occurrences 

  | Qual Module OccName
	-- A qualified name written by the user in 
	--  *source* code.  The module isn't necessarily 
	-- the module where the thing is defined; 
	-- just the one from which it is imported

  | Orig Module OccName
	-- An original name; the module is the *defining* module.
	-- This is used when GHC generates code that will be fed
	-- into the renamer (e.g. from deriving clauses), but where
	-- we want to say "Use Prelude.map dammit".  
 
  | Exact Name
	-- We know exactly the Name. This is used 
	--  (a) when the parser parses built-in syntax like "[]" 
	--	and "(,)", but wants a RdrName from it
	--  (b) when converting names to the RdrNames in IfaceTypes
	--	Here an Exact RdrName always contains an External Name
	--	(Internal Names are converted to simple Unquals)
	--  (c) by Template Haskell, when TH has generated a unique name</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p> 
      The OccName type is described in <a href="names.html#occname">The
	truth about names</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Renamer Monad</h2>
    <p>
      Due to the tight integration of the renamer with the typechecker, both
      use the same monad in recent versions of GHC.  So, we have
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
type RnM  a = TcRn a		-- Historical
type TcM  a = TcRn a		-- Historical</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      with the combined monad defined as
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
type TcRn a       = TcRnIf TcGblEnv TcLclEnv a
type TcRnIf a b c = IOEnv (Env a b) c

data Env gbl lcl	-- Changes as we move into an expression
  = Env {
	env_top	 :: HscEnv,	-- Top-level stuff that never changes
				-- Includes all info about imported things

	env_us   :: TcRef UniqSupply,	-- Unique supply for local varibles

	env_gbl  :: gbl,	-- Info about things defined at the top level
				-- of the module being compiled

	env_lcl  :: lcl		-- Nested stuff; changes as we go into 
				-- an expression
    }</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      the details of the global environment type <code>TcGblEnv</code> and
      local environment type <code>TcLclEnv</code> are also defined in the
      module <code>typecheck/TcRnTypes.lhs</code>.   The monad
      <code>IOEnv</code> is defined in <code>utils/IOEnv.hs</code> and extends
      the vanilla <code>IO</code> monad with an additional state parameter
      <code>env</code> that is treated as in a reader monad.  (Side effecting
      operations, such as updating the unique supply, are done with
      <code>TcRef</code>s, which are simply a synonym for <code>IORef</code>s.)
    </p>

    <h2>Name Space Management</h2>
    <p>
      As anticipated by the variants <code>Orig</code> and <code>Exact</code>
      of <code>RdrName</code> some names should not change during renaming,
      whereas others need to be turned into unique names.  In this context,
      the two functions <code>RnEnv.newTopSrcBinder</code> and
      <code>RnEnv.newLocals</code> are important:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
newTopSrcBinder :: Module -> Maybe Name -> Located RdrName -> RnM Name
newLocalsRn     :: [Located RdrName] -> RnM [Name]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The two functions introduces new toplevel and new local names,
      respectively, where the first two arguments to
      <code>newTopSrcBinder</code> determine the currently compiled module and
      the parent construct of the newly defined name.  Both functions create
      new names only for <code>RdrName</code>s that are neither exact nor
      original.
    </p>

    <h3>Introduction of Toplevel Names: Global RdrName Environment</h3>
    <p>
      A global <code>RdrName</code> environment
      <code>RdrName.GlobalRdrEnv</code> is a map from <code>OccName</code>s to
      lists of qualified names.  More precisely, the latter are
      <code>Name</code>s with an associated <code>Provenance</code>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
data Provenance
  = LocalDef		-- Defined locally
	Module

  | Imported 		-- Imported
	[ImportSpec]	-- INVARIANT: non-empty
	Bool		-- True iff the thing was named *explicitly* 
			-- in *any* of the import specs rather than being 
			-- imported as part of a group; 
	-- e.g.
	--	import B
	--	import C( T(..) )
	-- Here, everything imported by B, and the constructors of T
	-- are not named explicitly; only T is named explicitly.
	-- This info is used when warning of unused names.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The part of the global <code>RdrName</code> environment for a module
      that contains the local definitions is created by the function
      <code>RnNames.importsFromLocalDecls</code>, which also computes a data
      structure recording all imported declarations in the form of a value of
      type <code>TcRnTypes.ImportAvails</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The function <code>importsFromLocalDecls</code>, in turn, makes use of
      <code>RnNames.getLocalDeclBinders :: Module -> HsGroup RdrName -> RnM
      [AvailInfo]</code> to extract all declared names from a binding group,
      where <code>HscTypes.AvailInfo</code> is essentially a collection of
      <code>Name</code>s; i.e., <code>getLocalDeclBinders</code>, on the fly,
      generates <code>Name</code>s from the <code>RdrName</code>s of all
      top-level binders of the module represented by the <code>HsGroup
      RdrName</code> argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that all this happens before the renamer
      actually descends into the toplevel bindings of a module.  In other
      words, before <code>TcRnDriver.rnTopSrcDecls</code> performs the
      renaming of a module by way of <code>RnSource.rnSrcDecls</code>, it uses
      <code>importsFromLocalDecls</code> to set up the global
      <code>RdrName</code> environment, which contains <code>Name</code>s for
      all imported <em>and</em> all locally defined toplevel binders.  Hence,
      when the helpers of <code>rnSrcDecls</code> come across the
      <em>defining</em> occurences of a toplevel <code>RdrName</code>, they
      don't rename it by generating a new name, but they simply look up its
      name in the global <code>RdrName</code> environment.
    </p>

    <h2>Rebindable syntax</h2>
    <p>
      In Haskell when one writes "3" one gets "fromInteger 3", where
      "fromInteger" comes from the Prelude (regardless of whether the
      Prelude is in scope).  If you want to completely redefine numbers,
      that becomes inconvenient.  So GHC lets you say
      "-fno-implicit-prelude"; in that case, the "fromInteger" comes from
      whatever is in scope.  (This is documented in the User Guide.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This feature is implemented as follows (I always forget).
    <ul>
      <li>Names that are implicitly bound by the Prelude, are marked by the
	type <code>HsExpr.SyntaxExpr</code>.  Moreover, the association list
	<code>HsExpr.SyntaxTable</code> is set up by the renamer to map
	rebindable names to the value they are bound to.
      </li>
      <li>Currently, five constructs related to numerals
	(<code>HsExpr.NegApp</code>, <code>HsPat.NPat</code>,
	<code>HsPat.NPlusKPat</code>,  	<code>HsLit.HsIntegral</code>, and
	<code>HsLit.HsFractional</code>)  and 
	two constructs related to code>do</code> expressions
	(<code>HsExpr.BindStmt</code> and 
	<code>HsExpr.ExprStmt</code>) have rebindable syntax.
      </li> 
      <li> When the parser builds these constructs, it puts in the
	built-in Prelude Name (e.g. PrelNum.fromInteger).
      </li>
      <li> When the renamer encounters these constructs, it calls
      <tt>RnEnv.lookupSyntaxName</tt>. 
	This checks for <tt>-fno-implicit-prelude</tt>; if not, it just
	returns the same Name; otherwise it takes the occurrence name of the
	Name, turns it into an unqualified RdrName, and looks it up in the
	environment.  The returned name is plugged back into the construct.
      </li>
      <li> The typechecker uses the Name to generate the appropriate typing
	constraints. 
      </li>
    </ul>
