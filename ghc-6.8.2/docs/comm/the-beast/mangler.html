    <h1>The GHC Commentary - The Evil Mangler</h1>
    <p>
      The Evil Mangler (EM) is a Perl script invoked by the <a
	href="driver.html">Glorious Driver</a> after the C compiler (gcc) has
      translated the GHC-produced C code into assembly.  Consequently, it is
      only of interest if <code>-fvia-C</code> is in effect (either explicitly
      or implicitly).

    <h4>Its purpose</h4>
    <p>
      The EM reads the assembly produced by gcc and re-arranges code blocks as
      well as nukes instructions that it considers <em>non-essential.</em> It
      derives it evilness from its utterly ad hoc, machine, compiler, and
      whatnot dependent design and implementation.  More precisely, the EM
      performs the following tasks:
    <ul>
      <li>The code executed when a closure is entered is moved adjacent to
	that closure's infotable.  Moreover, the order of the info table
	entries is reversed.  Also, SRT pointers are removed from closures that
        don't need them (non-FUN, RET and THUNK ones).
      <li>Function prologue and epilogue code is removed.  (GHC generated code
	manages its own stack and uses the system stack only for return
	addresses and during calls to C code.)
      <li>Certain code patterns are replaced by simpler code (eg, loads of
	fast entry points followed by indirect jumps are replaced by direct
	jumps to the fast entry point).
    </ul>

    <h4>Implementation</h4>
    <p>
      The EM is located in the Perl script <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/driver/mangler/ghc-asm.lprl"><code>ghc-asm.lprl</code></a>.
      The script reads the <code>.s</code> file and chops it up into
      <em>chunks</em> (that's how they are actually called in the script) that
      roughly correspond to basic blocks.  Each chunk is annotated with an
      educated guess about what kind of code it contains (e.g., infotable,
      fast entry point, slow entry point, etc.).  The annotations also contain
      the symbol introducing the chunk of assembly and whether that chunk has
      already been processed or not.
    <p>
      The parsing of the input into chunks as well as recognising assembly
      instructions that are to be removed or altered is based on a large
      number of Perl regular expressions sprinkled over the whole code.  These
      expressions are rather fragile as they heavily rely on the structure of
      the generated code - in fact, they even rely on the right amount of
      white space and thus on the formatting of the assembly.
    <p>
      Afterwards, the chunks are reordered, some of them purged, and some
      stripped of some useless instructions.  Moreover, some instructions are
      manipulated (eg, loads of fast entry points followed by indirect jumps
      are replaced by direct jumps to the fast entry point).
    <p>
      The EM knows which part of the code belongs to function prologues and
      epilogues as <a href="../rts-libs/stgc.html">STG C</a> adds tags of the
      form <code>--- BEGIN ---</code> and <code>--- END ---</code> the
      assembler just before and after the code proper of a function starts.
      It adds these tags using gcc's <code>__asm__</code> feature.
    <p>
      <strong>Update:</strong> Gcc 2.96 upwards performs more aggressive basic
      block re-ordering and dead code elimination.  This seems to make the
      whole <code>--- END ---</code> tag business redundant -- in fact, if
      proper code is generated, no <code>--- END ---</code> tags survive gcc
      optimiser.
