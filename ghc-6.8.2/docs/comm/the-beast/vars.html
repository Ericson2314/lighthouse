    <h1>The GHC Commentary - The Real Story about Variables, Ids, TyVars, and the like</h1>
    <p>


<h2>Variables</h2>

The <code>Var</code> type, defined in <code>basicTypes/Var.lhs</code>,
represents variables, both term variables and type variables:
<pre>
    data Var
      = Var {
	    varName    :: Name,
	    realUnique :: FastInt,
	    varType    :: Type,
	    varDetails :: VarDetails,
	    varInfo    :: IdInfo		
	}
</pre>
<ul>
<li> The <code>varName</code> field contains the identity of the variable:
its unique number, and its print-name.  See "<a href="names.html">The truth about names</a>".

<p><li> The <code>realUnique</code> field caches the unique number in the
<code>varName</code> field, just to make comparison of <code>Var</code>s a little faster.

<p><li> The <code>varType</code> field gives the type of a term variable, or the kind of a
type variable.  (Types and kinds are both represented by a <code>Type</code>.)

<p><li> The <code>varDetails</code> field distinguishes term variables from type variables,
and makes some further distinctions (see below).

<p><li> For term variables (only) the <code>varInfo</code> field contains lots of useful
information: strictness, unfolding, etc.  However, this information is all optional;
you can always throw away the <code>IdInfo</code>.  In contrast, you can't safely throw away
the <code>VarDetails</code> of a <code>Var</code>
</ul>
<p>
It's often fantastically convenient to have term variables and type variables
share a single data type.  For example, 
<pre>
  exprFreeVars :: CoreExpr -> VarSet
</pre>
If there were two types, we'd need to return two sets.  Simiarly, big lambdas and
little lambdas use the same constructor in Core, which is extremely convenient.
<p>
We define a couple of type synonyms:
<pre>
  type Id    = Var  -- Term variables
  type TyVar = Var  -- Type variables
</pre>
just to help us document the occasions when we are expecting only term variables,
or only type variables.


<h2> The <code>VarDetails</code> field </h2>

The <code>VarDetails</code> field tells what kind of variable this is:
<pre>
data VarDetails
  = LocalId 		-- Used for locally-defined Ids (see NOTE below)
	LocalIdDetails

  | GlobalId 		-- Used for imported Ids, dict selectors etc
	GlobalIdDetails

  | TyVar
  | MutTyVar (IORef (Maybe Type)) 	-- Used during unification;
	     TyVarDetails
</pre>

<a name="TyVar">
<h2>Type variables (<code>TyVar</code>)</h2>
</a>
<p>
The <code>TyVar</code> case is self-explanatory.  The <code>MutTyVar</code>
case is used only during type checking.  Then a type variable can be unified,
using an imperative update, with a type, and that is what the
<code>IORef</code> is for.  The <code>TcType.TyVarDetails</code> field records
the sort of type variable we are dealing with.  It is defined as
<pre>
data TyVarDetails = SigTv | ClsTv | InstTv | VanillaTv
</pre>
<code>SigTv</code> marks type variables that were introduced when
instantiating a type signature prior to matching it against the inferred type
of a definition.  The variants <code>ClsTv</code> and <code>InstTv</code> mark
scoped type variables introduced by class and instance heads, respectively.
These first three sorts of type variables are skolem variables (tested by the
predicate <code>isSkolemTyVar</code>); i.e., they must <em>not</em> be
instantiated. All other type variables are marked as <code>VanillaTv</code>.
<p>
For a long time I tried to keep mutable Vars statically type-distinct
from immutable Vars, but I've finally given up.   It's just too painful.
After type checking there are no MutTyVars left, but there's no static check
of that fact.

<h2>Term variables (<code>Id</code>)</h2>

A term variable (of type <code>Id</code>) is represented either by a
<code>LocalId</code> or a <code>GlobalId</code>:
<p>
A <code>GlobalId</code> is
<ul>
<li> Always bound at top-level.
<li> Always has a <code>GlobalName</code>, and hence has 
     a <code>Unique</code> that is globally unique across the whole
     GHC invocation (a single invocation may compile multiple modules).
<li> Has <code>IdInfo</code> that is absolutely fixed, forever.
</ul>

<p>
A <code>LocalId</code> is:
<ul> 
<li> Always bound in the module being compiled:
<ul>
<li> <em>either</em> bound within an expression (lambda, case, local let(rec))
<li> <em>or</em> defined at top level in the module being compiled.
</ul>
<li> Has IdInfo that changes as the simpifier bashes repeatedly on it.
</ul>
<p>
The key thing about <code>LocalId</code>s is that the free-variable finder
typically treats them as candidate free variables. That is, it ignores
<code>GlobalId</code>s such as imported constants, data contructors, etc.
<p>
An important invariant is this: <em>All the bindings in the module
being compiled (whether top level or not) are <code>LocalId</code>s
until the CoreTidy phase.</em> In the CoreTidy phase, all
externally-visible top-level bindings are made into GlobalIds.  This
is the point when a <code>LocalId</code> becomes "frozen" and becomes
a fixed, immutable <code>GlobalId</code>.
<p>
(A binding is <em>"externally-visible"</em> if it is exported, or
mentioned in the unfolding of an externally-visible Id.  An
externally-visible Id may not have an unfolding, either because it is
too big, or because it is the loop-breaker of a recursive group.)

<h3>Global Ids and implicit Ids</h3>

<code>GlobalId</code>s are further categorised by their <code>GlobalIdDetails</code>.
This type is defined in <code>basicTypes/IdInfo</code>, because it mentions other
structured types like <code>DataCon</code>.  Unfortunately it is *used* in <code>Var.lhs</code>
so there's a <code>hi-boot</code> knot to get it there.  Anyway, here's the declaration:
<pre>
data GlobalIdDetails
  = NotGlobalId			-- Used as a convenient extra return value 
                                -- from globalIdDetails

  | VanillaGlobal		-- Imported from elsewhere

  | PrimOpId PrimOp		-- The Id for a primitive operator
  | FCallId ForeignCall		-- The Id for a foreign call

  -- These next ones are all "implicit Ids"
  | RecordSelId FieldLabel	-- The Id for a record selector
  | DataConId DataCon		-- The Id for a data constructor *worker*
  | DataConWrapId DataCon	-- The Id for a data constructor *wrapper*
				-- [the only reasons we need to know is so that
				--  a) we can  suppress printing a definition in the interface file
				--  b) when typechecking a pattern we can get from the
				--     Id back to the data con]
</pre>
The <code>GlobalIdDetails</code> allows us to go from the <code>Id</code> for 
a record selector, say, to its field name; or the <code>Id</code> for a primitive
operator to the <code>PrimOp</code> itself.
<p>
Certain <code>GlobalId</code>s are called <em>"implicit"</em> Ids.  An implicit
Id is derived by implication from some other declaration.  So a record selector is
derived from its data type declaration, for example.  An implicit Ids is always 
a <code>GlobalId</code>.  For most of the compilation, the implicit Ids are just
that: implicit.  If you do -ddump-simpl you won't see their definition.  (That's
why it's true to say that until CoreTidy all Ids in this compilation unit are
LocalIds.)  But at CorePrep, a binding is added for each implicit Id defined in
this module, so that the code generator will generate code for the (curried) function.
<p>
Implicit Ids carry their unfolding inside them, of course, so they may well have
been inlined much earlier; but we generate the curried top-level defn just in
case its ever needed.

<h3>LocalIds</h3>

The <code>LocalIdDetails</code> gives more info about a <code>LocalId</code>:
<pre>
data LocalIdDetails 
  = NotExported	-- Not exported
  | Exported	-- Exported
  | SpecPragma	-- Not exported, but not to be discarded either
		-- It's unclean that this is so deeply built in
</pre>
From this we can tell whether the <code>LocalId</code> is exported, and that
tells us whether we can drop an unused binding as dead code. 
<p>
The <code>SpecPragma</code> thing is a HACK.  Suppose you write a SPECIALIZE pragma:
<pre>
   foo :: Num a => a -> a
   {-# SPECIALIZE foo :: Int -> Int #-}
   foo = ...
</pre>
The type checker generates a dummy call to <code>foo</code> at the right types:
<pre>
   $dummy = foo Int dNumInt
</pre>
The Id <code>$dummy</code> is marked <code>SpecPragma</code>.  Its role is to hang
onto that call to <code>foo</code> so that the specialiser can see it, but there
are no calls to <code>$dummy</code>.
The simplifier is careful not to discard <code>SpecPragma</code> Ids, so that it
reaches the specialiser.  The specialiser processes the right hand side of a <code>SpecPragma</code> Id
to find calls to overloaded functions, <em>and then discards the <code>SpecPragma</code> Id</em>.
So <code>SpecPragma</code> behaves a like <code>Exported</code>, at least until the specialiser.


<h3> ExternalNames and InternalNames </h3>

Notice that whether an Id is a <code>LocalId</code> or <code>GlobalId</code> is 
not the same as whether the Id has an <code>ExternaName</code> or an <code>InternalName</code>
(see "<a href="names.html#sort">The truth about Names</a>"):
<ul>
<li> Every <code>GlobalId</code> has an <code>ExternalName</code>.
<li> A <code>LocalId</code> might have either kind of <code>Name</code>.
</ul>
