    <h1>The GHC Commentary - Mindboggling Makefiles</h1>
    <p>
      The size and structure of GHC's makefiles makes it quite easy to scream
      out loud - in pain - during the process of tracking down problems in the
      make system or when attempting to alter it.  GHC's <a
	href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building">Building
	Guide</a> has valuable information on <a
	href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building/BuildSystem">the
	makefile architecture.</a>

    <h4>A maze of twisty little passages, all alike</h4>
    <p>
      The <code>fptools/</code> toplevel and the various project directories
      contain not only a <code>Makefile</code> each, but there are
      subdirectories of name <code>mk/</code> at various levels that contain
      rules, targets, and so on specific to a project - or, in the case of the
      toplevel, the default rules for the whole system.  Each <code>mk/</code>
      directory contains a file <code>boilerplate.mk</code> that ties the
      various other makefiles together.  Files called <code>target.mk</code>,
      <code>paths.mk</code>, and <code>suffix.mk</code> contain make targets,
      definitions of variables containing paths, and suffix rules,
      respectively.
    <p>
      One particularly nasty trick used in this hierarchy of makefiles is the
      way in which the variable <code>$(TOP)</code> is used.  AFAIK,
      <code>$(TOP)</code> always points to a directory containing an
      <code>mk/</code> subdirectory; however, it not necessarily points to the
      toplevel <code>fptools/</code> directory.  For example, within the GHC
      subtree, <code>$(TOP)</code> points to <code>fptools/ghc/</code>.
      However, some of the makefiles in <code>fptools/ghc/mk/</code> will then
      <em>temporarily</em> redefine <code>$(TOP)</code> to point a level
      higher (i.e., to <code>fptools/</code>) while they are including the
      toplevel boilerplate.  After that <code>$(TOP)</code> is redefined to
      whatever value it had before including makefiles from higher up in the
      hierarchy.
