    <h1>Other Sources of Wisdom</h1>
    <p>
      Believe it or not, but there are other people besides you who are
      masochistic enough to study the innards of the beast.  Some of the have
      been kind (or cruel?) enough to share their insights with us.  Here is a
      probably incomplete list:
    <p>
    <ul>

      <li>The <a
      href="http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk/~dsg/gph/docs/StgSurvival.ps.gz">STG
	  Survival Sheet</a> has -- according to its header -- been written by
	  `a poor wee soul',<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> which
	  probably has been pushed into the torments of madness by the very
	  act of contemplating the inner workings of the STG runtime system.
	  This document discusses GHC's runtime system with a focus on
	  support for parallel processing (aka GUM).

      <li>Instructions on <a
      href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~olaf/PUBLICATIONS/extendGHC.html">Adding 
	  an Optimisation Pass to the Glasgow Haskell Compiler</a> 
	have been compiled by <a
	href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~olaf/">Olaf Chitil</a>.
	Unfortunately, this document is already a little aged.

      <li><a href="http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~apt/">Andrew Tolmach</a> has defined 
	<a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/papers/core.ps.gz">an external
	  representation of
	  GHC's <em>Core</em> language</a> and also implemented a GHC pass
	that emits the intermediate form into <code>.hcr</code> files.  The
	option <code>-fext-core</code> triggers GHC to emit Core code after
	optimisation; in addition, <code>-fno-code</code> is often used to
	stop compilation after Core has been emitted.

	<!-- Add references to other background texts listed on the GHC docu
	page 
	-->

    </ul>

    <p><hr><p>
      <sup><a name="footnote1">1</a></sup>Usually reliable sources have it that
      the poor soul in question is no one less than GUM hardcore hacker <a
