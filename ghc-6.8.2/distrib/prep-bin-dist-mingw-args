# Running 'binary-dist' gives us a tree which

# To use:
#
#   foo$ cd <top of fptools build tree>
#   foo$ make binary-dist Project=Ghc 
#   foo$ cd ghc-<version>
#   foo$ ../distrib/prep-bin-dist-mingw-args <perl-dir> <mingw-top> <mingw-gcc-lib>
#

# Directory where a (cygwin-free) perl binary resides.
export perl_dir=$1

# Top of the MinGW32 compiler directory
export mingw_top=$2

# The gcc-lib directory of the mingw tree you want to
# include with the binary dist.
export gcc_lib=$mingw_top/$3

#
# The mingw include, lib, and bin directories.

export mingw_include=$mingw_top/include
export mingw_lib=$mingw_top/lib
