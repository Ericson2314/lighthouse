This is a Haskell library for writing CGI programs. 
Its features include:

- Access to CGI parameters (e.g. form input) from both 
  GET and POST requests.
- Access to CGI environment variables.
- Ability to set arbitrary response headers.
- Support for HTTP cookies.
- An efficient implementation of multipart/form-data 
  using Data.ByteString. This allows for efficient 
  handling of file uploads.
- Wrapper functions for compatibility with the old 
  Network.CGI module.
- A CGI monad transformer.
- Basic exception handling and logging (these should be improved)
- Low-level run functions that allow using programs written with 
  this package with protocols other than CGI, for example FastCGI.
