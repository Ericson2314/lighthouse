Getting started with hacking on GHC
-----------------------------------

So you've decided to hack on GHC, congratulations!  We hope you have a
rewarding experience.  This file will point you in the direction of
information to help you get started right away.


The GHC Developer's Wiki
------------------------

  The home for GHC Developers, with information on accessing the
  latest sources, the bug tracker, and documentation on the
  code:
  
  http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc
  
  In particular, the wiki contains the following pages of interest to
  new hackers:
  
  Quick Start for developers

     http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building/Hacking 
   
     This section on the wiki will get you up and running with a
     serviceable build tree in no time:
  
     This is part of the "Building GHC" section of the wiki, which
     has more detailed information on GHC's build system should you
     need it.


  Coding conventions

     http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/WorkingConventions

     This wiki page explains the ground rules for code that is intended
     to go into the mainline compiler source.
  
  
  The GHC Commentary
  
     http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/wiki/Commentary

     Notes on the internals and architecture of GHC.
     

Mailing lists
-------------

   Ask on glasgow-haskell-users@haskell.org if you have difficulties.
   If you're working with the current CVS sources of GHC, then
   cvs-ghc@haskell.org might be a more appropriate (developers hang
   out here).  See http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo for
   subscription.
