To make user executables:

1. Write a normal C file.  THe first function in the file 
(not necessarily called main) will be the entry point.
You should be able to use most standard C features except
(just for the moment) floating point.  There is no
access to command line arguments.

2. The only library functions available are:

exit
malloc
free
printf
abs
isdigit
memcpy
memmove
memset
strcmp
strcpy
strncpy
strnlen
strrchr
atof

3. Compile and link your file using the 'doit' script.  Compilation
is normal; linking is rather special, and makes use of the ld script
file 'script'. 

4. Make the resulting code available as a grub module, and execute
it using the command 'run' giving the (full) module name as argument.
